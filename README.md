# kieserchart

## Improvement ideas

- [x] make sure it works with current csv data structure
- [x] add "sec" to charts
- [x] add new chart line, which shows global curve (Average)
- [x] make "lbs" on Y axe visible (is outside the box now)
- [x] group by type of machines (A, B...)
  - [ ] make sure groups can be shown separately in the chart
- [x] use similar colors for the same machine-group (colors from the same main-color palette)
- [ ] add thumb images with infos about muscles
- [x] make UI beautiful
- [x] make it work on mobile devices
- [x] add some padding around the chart, so the chart lines/text are not cut off
- [ ] add weekends to the chart (visually separation)
- [x] remove "lbs" from charts legend, show only machine name
- [ ] add icons for different machine groups next to the machine name (body-parts as icons)
- [ ] add arrow top/bottom to LBS in tooltip table according to previous entry
- [ ] double checke Average item, seems to have wrong calculation 
- [x] tooltip:
  - [x] make it visually beautiful
  - [x] remove "lbs" from table
